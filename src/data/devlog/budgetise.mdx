## Overview

During my last year at Sheridan College while in the Software Development and Network
Engineering advanced diploma program, I had to complete a capstone project with 4 teammates to
summarize and show what we learnt over the lifetime of the program.

To complete the capstone my team had to ether choose a client from a list or
come up and complete an idea. Our group decided to try and land a client.

Our first choice was for a project where you would be required to design and
create a budgeting application for an owner of 12 franchise stores for a fast
food company. We landed it.

The owner wanted to find a solution that would allow him to track his expenses
closer and get ride of his old workflow of using spreadsheets. We came up with
budgetise to solve his problem.

## Contributions

- Created the entire design of the site and landing page
- Created initial design of the project and Git workflow
- Added User registration and security features
- Helped teammates become knowledgeable about tools and packages project used
- Presented and showcased at sheridan's capstone competition
- Helped with presentations

## Purpose

Initially the owner was managing his stores expenses using excel spreadsheets but
as he started to acquire more he noticed that there would be multiple spreadsheets
floating around his upper management. These spreadsheets were huge with over 25
sections to them that only kept a year's worth of data. Problems included:

1. Versioning the spreadsheets. It was hard to tell who had the most recent copy.
2. Inconsistent Data. Sheets needed to regularly be double or tripled checked because of mis-input.
3. No way to gather statistical data to discover deeper trends.
4. Permissions and data privacy. Spreadsheets provide no way to inherently hide data.

## Solution

In an effort to help the store owner manage his stores better we decided to create
a website that mimicked his excel worksheet workflow but with extra features.
Based on our research there were six core area's our solution will focus on:

1. Managing Store Information
2. Managing Store Budget
3. Automating Data Input
4. Reporting and Dashboards
5. Managing Outside Service
6. Managing Users and Permission

## Planning Process

Because this project was a capstone project, there was a 4 month planning process
with regular meeting between our team, our client and our professors (or
as they would say Investors). This aloud us to map out a rough layout for the
site as well as develop our user stories to follow to implement processes like
authentication, user management, budget management, and reporting.

Along with developing a report we did some research about possible SAAS companies that
may already somewhat fill this niche market.

## Workflow

Every project requires a workflow and our was no different. We decided to move in
agile style where each branch was a new task to complete in a bigger user story.
When ever a part was finished, me or my teammate Lawrence would look through and
test the new feature the branch introduced to the app. Once approved by one of us,
we would merge the feature into the master branch.

## Technology

Our team choose to use Angular 2+ on the frontend and Typescript with Express on the
backend. I chose to use a full Typescript stack because some of our teammate's
didn't have enough experience to learn a new language on top of developing a
complicated monolith. Live updating was really important to us because we
envisioned this app to be able to be used in a team so we included web sockets
into our project. We decided to use postgres as our database picked up typeorm
as our orm to interact with the database. We deployed our solution onto a server
hosted on Digital Ocean using Nginx as our web server.

## Difficulties and Challenges

I think the biggies difficulty our project faced was experience. In our project
we had one developer who was struggling in school and the added pressure of our
capstone didn't help. Your only as strong as your weakest link, so I that I would
help him get up to speed on the project and give him smaller and similar tasks
to accomplish. When he finished we would join a skype call together and review
his work. If he ever got stuck I would quickly get online and ask him questions
to try and help guide him to the correct solution. I found this helped him improve
quite a bit and in the last 7 weeks or so he was able to complete a small module
for our project.

## Showcase

We were able to make it into the sheridan capstone showcase with our projects
and our amazing class presentations. At the showcase we were setup right next to the
door so we could be sure to get as much attention as possible as we tried to
woo the people that came in to checkout ours and other cool projects that were
at the showcase. In the end we ended up winning second place and came home with
a medal.

## Reflection

Overall I'm really happy with my team and the significant progress we made over
the 1 year development cycle of planning and prototyping different UI layouts
and user experiences. Coming into our final term, the team members was at different
skill levels with our core tech stack. Confronted with this challenge, I spent
time and effort to bring other members up to speed and reach reasonable
productivity levels.

Our client is delighted with how the project is progressing. This knowledge will
fuel us to work hard towards delivering an amazing product.  The ultimate goal is
to exceed our first clientâ€™s expectations, with an eye on future clients.
