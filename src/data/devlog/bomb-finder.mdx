## Overview

Bomb Finder is meant to be a re-make of the popular game minesweeper. It was built
as a fun exercise that looked at adding small features to the game such as game
templates, game statistics and settings for graphics and game play. The main
inspiration for this project was brought on by Google creating they're own clone
called proxx<sup>[[1](#proxx)]</sup>.

## Goals

1. Make Bomb Finder a PWA (progressive web app) as well as score 100 in the lighthouse browser tests
2. Use IndexDB to persist data. Data represents settings, statistics, game templates and game's currently in progress
3. Bomb Finder should alway keep state, even when the game is turned off by the user
4. Bomb Finder should feel like a native app experience.
5. Canvas2d must be used for the game board

## Technologies

Bomb Finder is build with React and Typescript. It currently isn't connected to
any backend services so it makes use of the browsers provided features to save
data. Currently I am using indexDB (if provided) to save all of the users data.
I chose IndexDB because it doesn't run on the main thread while session and
local storage do. This helps when rendering the game board at 60 fps and reduces
overhead of completing the update and render operations when a user interacts with
the board.

## Design process

I'm not a designer but I try to follow a workflow for all of my projects. I initially
started by writing my goals I want my project to accomplish as well as all the
pages I wanted to include. After deciding on what pages to include I got started
on a simple designs of how I would expect it too look on each page.

<div class="image--center">
    <props.images.bomb_finder_sitemap alt="Initial design of the sitemap" caption="sitemap for bomb finder"/>
</div>

Development initially started with the project using React's smaller alternative
Preact<sup>[[7](#preact)]</sup>. While using Preact<sup>[[7](#preact)]</sup> I rolled my own webpack build configuration but I had
trouble figuring out a way to support code-splitting as well as use typescript.
These frustrations lasted about a week and after unsuccessfully getting code splitting
to work I decided to switch to Reacts CRA<sup>[[4](#CRA)]</sup> (create-react-app) because of my
pervious experience with it. CRA<sup>[[4](#CRA)]</sup> allowed me to quickly get the
project started and focus on the design of my components and pages.

I first started by adding content to the pages before I implemented designs.
This allowed me to move quickly in developing the app and getting all of the features
I wanted out of it like utilizing IndexDB and rendering with canvas2d. It also
allowed me to focus on developing minesweeper's game mechanics.

After I had added a majority of the required feature's, I went back and filled
the app out with a very basic design, using a very sad color palette of shades:

<h4>Shades</h4>
<div>
    <span class="color--square bf-shade-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square bf-shade-2"></span>
    <span class="color--square bf-shade-3"></span>
</div>

## Difficulties and Challenges

Bomb Finder was pretty simple to create but because of some of the features that
I was trying to implement into the program I run into some difficulties. One
of the biggest ones was developing the game board to support hundreds to thousands
of pieces. My initial implementation moved from piece to piece and drew they're
current state. This meant that I redrew each image on every render loop. This
solution work on small boards such as 5x5 and 10x10 but became a problem when
playing on bigger boards like 16x16 and 24x24.

To solve this problem, I first visited MDN<sup>[[3](#MDN)]</sup> where it said you can
render each piece alone on an invisible canvas, then copy and paste the invisible canvas
into the games canvas. This idea sounded great so I implemented it for all 21 pieces.

This worked great and solved my problem on desktop where I had a lot of power but on
mobile I was still having issues with my framerate. I realized that on mobile, you
can't really see most of the screen anyways, so why not just skip rendering pieces
off screen. So I did that.

Aside from rendering problems, there was also challenged with finding a solution to read and write
data to IndexDB effectivity and in a way that hid all of the logic needed to actually
read and write from IndexDB. This lead me to perse typescript annotation to register
data class to database classes on startup as well as give access to the database
when the application is running. Once registered the browser will be able to create,
select or edit the table so it matches the data model.

One of the problems I wasn't able to solve was caused because of the Typescript annotations I made to
interact with IndexDB. To understand the problem you need to understand what CRA
does while compiling the program for development and what it does to compile the
program for production. While in development mode all of the classes
name's aren't simplified, this means when you call ```function.constructor.name ```
you get the name of the class. In production all the class names are simplified
meaning that the name of the class at runtime has changed. Have the class name
change is a big deal during runtime because that means we need to manually set
the table that the field is supposed to belong to because there is not way to
get it during runtime without using a static string.

The result of this change made a nice looking data model like this:

```Typescript
@Table()
class Preferences {
    @Field(true)
    readonly id: string;

    @Field()
    defaultCellSize: number = 35;
    ...
}
```

Into this:

```Typescript
@Table("settings")
class Preferences {
    @Field("settings", true)
    readonly id: string;

    @Field("settings")
    defaultCellSize: number = 35;
    ...
}
```

This could be solved by ejecting the build config but that is a massive downside
compared to just hard coding the table name to all of the fields and table.

## The Problem of updating

So when rendering to the screen we want the canvas to run at 60fps. When running
at this speed we need to keep track of time. To render one would normally call
to ```Javascript window.requestAnimationFrame(callback)``` and inside the call
back you would receive a time in micro seconds on how long the current page has
been opened? The problem comes when a user clicks off the page and then clicks
on again and the time would sky rocket

## Project Status

This project is at a finished stage. It is completed and is fully
usable and installable. I'm still deciding weather it's worth it to try and
extend the project.

## What's Next

- Make Bomb Finder into a trusted web app<sup>[[5](#TWA)]</sup>
- Allow player's to pick they're color for the background on the game board
- Add way to turn off satisfied tiles handicap
- Add more animations for game bored pieces
- Add a High score table (online functionality)
- Add way for friends to challenge each other to a game
  - same seed
  - different seed
  - competitive version
  - battle royal???

## Reflections

At the end of the day this project is a completed project that I'm really proud
to show people. I learned a lot about chrome dev tools and profiling my performance
code. It was a lot of fun creating the animations and working with canvas2d. Using
Reacts CRA helped a lot to quickly get the project running. I think this project
could have been improved by doing some initial design planning at the start of
project. It could have been a big asset to spend a couple of days in Figma<sup>[[6](#figma)]</sup>
to quickly prototype possible designs and color schemes that would be more attractive
then my sad color palette. Other then the design I feel as though I hit all my goals
I wanted to hit and am really proud of that!
