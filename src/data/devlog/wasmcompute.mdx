## Problem

The world is changing and so is the way that developers deploy software.
What was once deploying a webserver to a virtual machine has matured
into developers deploying containers and having tools that help them
orchestrate deployment of them (Kubernetes). I believe the next and
final wave of this saga is serverless computing. It's already gaining
hold in the market as companies move away from Kubernetes to use
serverless solution offerings from cloud providers like AWS and Azures.

Like any innovation there is growing pains as more companies and
individuals start moving their workload to the cloud and realizing they
don't support all of the features and specifications they need.
Serverless is a wonderful technology but doesn't provide all of the
grantee's developers are accustom to when developing internet
applications. Serverless offerings today have many areas to overcome
such as cost, cold start time, resource limitations, security, scaling
and supporting long running applications.

Wasmcompute is meant to be my answer to all of these problems.

## Overview

Wasmcompute is meant to be a stateful serverless platform that runs off
of web assembly. It contains an online platform and a command line
application that gives you access to upload your functions quickly and
easily. The platform is opinionated and creates a new function for every
git commit you push to the platform. This allows developers to run
multiple tests once new versions is released. It also allows you to
reference other functions in code and run them on your own machine.

This is meant to be an ambitious project that will take a couple of
years to complete. It's supposed to be more of a tool for me and for me
to practice developing a large project. The second goal is to make the
tool profitable and to help others.

## Goals

The goals for the wasmcompute platform consist of the following:

1.  Run web assembly functions in the cloud
2.  Write stateful serverless functions without configuration files
3.  Quick start up with clear costs
4.  Referencing personal and 3^rd^ party functions is easy
5.  Building a pipeline of multiple functions is easy
6.  Integrated type checking
7.  Develop functions in any language
8.  Give developers and devops engineers the tools to do their job

However, the project is not close to the overview or the goals of the project.
This post will cover the history of wasmcompute and all of it's failures and
successes.

## Development Process

It's been now over a year since start this project (I was working on it
off and on during 2020). During this period, I've used multiple
different technologies and have changed direction and refactored
multiple times.

### Initial development

Development for Wasmcompute started in early 2020 using Golang as the
primary language of choice and using wasmer as the library to the web
assembly scripts on the backend. React was used on the frontend and I
used material UI as my component library. Authentication was setup to
support email and password as well as GitHub OAuth tokens. I was just
playing around developing what I thought would be a good prototype
without any planning (which I know, isn't smart).

</div>

The application focused on creating a UI where you could create a
project that would automatically support CRUD (create, read, update,
delete) operations. Using the UI, you could input the database table you
wanted to create, and it would reflect that in the database. Every time
you create a new table, I would auto generate CRUD routes and view
models that would support your application and act as an API.

For this initial project, I was planning for users to create their
database using the UI then upload a unique web assembly script
(programmed in rust) for the custom logic that they may need.

At the time, I was also learning new technologies. I was taking my first
steps in learn AWS (Amazon Web Services) and using terraform to handle
all of my infrastructure. It was my first major project using Golang and
included close to 5000 lines of code.

After a couple of months, I realized I had lost my vision for what I
wanted the project to be (which was a web assembly, serverless
platform). I decided I needed to start over and change my direction.

### Changing directions

I started a new project with a new understanding what I wanted to build.
For this second attempt I decided to use Rust because I didn't know if
even this project would succeed, and I wanted to use Rust on a more
serious project then just creating bitmap images. I decided that there
was no real point in focusing on developing a UI first because this tool
was meant for developers to quickly create web services. Therefore, I
decided to build a CLI application that would be coupled with my
platform.

I got started building and after about 3 weeks I had my first working
prototypes. This project was better and include a couple of different
parts.

1.  I had my web server that would deal with managing and running the platform
2.  I had a CLI that would support the user to build and deploy their web assembly projects
3.  I had a rust library that would allow developers to interface with
    some custom API's I had. This API would allow access to a Sqlite
    database on the platform and other services. WASI would give the
    develop access to the operating system.

I decided that it was time to test it out. I built a helloworld project
and a documentation project where I've stored all of my notes about the
design of the application. The following is a couple of screen shots
taken throughout a working version of the app running locally.

### Understanding the Final Product

After getting to this point, I was happy with the progress, but it felt
as though I was still on the wrong path. During this time, I was also
beginning to research other web assembly serverless solutions and found
a couple that was sort of already doing what my application was doing.
This demotivated me and I pondered for weeks if this project was even
worth the time anymore.

After weeks thinking, I decided it was still was. Current solutions on
the market are still not focusing in the right areas and I think I'll be
able to get it right. Although I would love to share more information
right now, I'm not ready. I am currently doing more documentation work
and researching recent papers so that I can learn more about what other
companies and people are doing. I hope to learn from them as well as
integrate what worked into my platform.

The next post I create for this project will include more documentation
and information on what the future of the platform will include. It will
be a more technical and will dive into my plans for the platform and
include diagrams and plans on how I intend to build it.

## Technologies

This project currently has me embarking on many new technologies. I used
Golang, Rust, Terraform, AWS, Web Assembly, GitHub (Hooks and
Authentication) and Postgres. I also used React for the first version of
the project but ended up dropping it in the second because I believe the
frontend UI doesn't need to be so complicated and complex. Also because
I thought managing rendering pages on the server would be easier. I
ended up using Handlebars (for rust) instead.

The one technology I hope to add to this project is Ansible for
deployment to web servers.

## Difficulties

One of the main difficulties during the development in Rust was the use
of a HTTP web server library called tide. I decided to use it because I
thought it was a young project that I would be able to help contribute
to. I've always wanted to give back to an open-source project because I
feel like I've finally become a skilled programmer and would love to
help the community. I needed support for routing on subdomains, so I put
in an issue to talk about it. There were some discussions, and I went
off and built the support for it. However, it is sadly still in a PR
today and I understand why, it ended up being 500 new additions to the
code base so it was not a small addition, but I hope that the project
maintainers are still considering adding it.

If I were to go back in time, I would have chosen to use hyper or a more
mature project for my web server needs, that way I could create all of
my own custom logic on top of http server. Though I may just do this
depending on how I feel the refactoring goes for the current project.

Another difficulty I had was not planning nearly enough. It would have
helped me a lot to create smaller goals then aim to create a new big
platform. Although I don't see the first 6 months of the start of this
project as wasted, I defiantly could have spent less time on the
prototype had I documented better what I wanted from the beginning.

Lastly, I'm not happy with how the UI looks for the current website but
part of me just wanted to try and deploy the project to get it working
on the web but to my understanding it isn't doing very well online and
it's broken down a couple of times. I've had to SSH in to turn it back
on couple of times after doing something wrong. The next time I deploy
this project I need to have a better CI/CD plan in place that work as
well as a better change log.

## Project Status

The project is still in progress and will be for some time. I believe
that it will take one more year to get to a more stable place and
another year for me to write all of the features I want for it.

## Results

The result of the project is currently at wasmcompute.com. Although just
be careful right now (Jan 2021) because the version that's deployed can
and will fall over in a moment's notice.

## Reflections

This was the second big project that I've worked on (Budgetise being the
first) though it is probably one that I am most proud even in its bad
state. I believe it has promise to become a platform that other
developers use. Maybe it can become something like GitHub pages, Netify,
Azure Durable Functions and Cloudflare workers all in one. All that's
left is for me to do more work on it and hopefully one day it will be
ready for the world. I'll be sure to write an update once the project
reaches its next step.
