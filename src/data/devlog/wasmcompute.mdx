## Overview

A dream of easily deploing and hosting code for free* in the cloud. Wasmcompute
is a web application that allows users to update load their web assembly scripts
for free on our servers. We provide users with a web assembly runtime and a
unique URL they can use to test out their applications. With access to CDN static
file hosting and a simple Sqlite database on the backend, theres little you can't
do using our services.

**Work in progress still**

## What is Webassembly (WASM)

Wasm is like compiled Java, it's byte code. So all you need is an interpreter to
read it. It also has helpful functionality where you can import a function call
from your host environment. Wasm is safe because it doesn't actually have access
to the underlying OS. The only way it gets access is through your imported host
functions. To clarify, Wasm is basically a dumb machine, can't do anything
without your help.

We as hosts provide the bindings for you but in the future we see the possibility
where you can code any application and we'll work on keeping it alive and running
fast.

## What is the dream of Wasmcompute

I dream of being able to program an entire web application, being able to test it
on wasmcompute and validate the idea. If validated, the application deployment
process to actually deploy the app should be painless and smooth. Theres still a
lot more work to be done, but i guess thats why we call it a dream.
