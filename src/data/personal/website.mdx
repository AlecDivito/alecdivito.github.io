## Overview
A website that is able to act as a resume for my skills and hobbies for anyone
who is interested. This gives me the ability as well to have a platform to
start a blog or something bigger that could help develop others skills.

## Goals
The major goal of creating this website was to expand my resume. Right now it's
only one page and I like that. I only include what I'm most proud of on it, this
website allows interviews learn more about me. Another goal was to be able to
explain my design process on some of my projects and talk about how I created
them.

## Technologies
I used Gatsby as my static site generator, I really enjoyed using it and felt right
at home because of how heavily it uses React. I used Javascript instead of my
usually Typescript and regert that. I really miss my types. To style I use SCSS.
I did have some difficullty starting the project and finding what is avaliable
for Gatsby (which is why I ended up using Javascript). After I starting pointing
my filesystem in the correct directory most of my issues didn't matter as much
anymore.

## Design Process
When starting this project I wanted to use

<h3>Shades</h3>

    <span class="color--square shade-3"></span>

## Difficulties
The biggiest difficulty was finding a good color and even now I'm still not
very satisfied with my pick of blues and 

## Project Status
Is a resume ever done? No, so I guess this website is never done but that's ok.
But overall the website is currently at a completed stage that I am happy with.

## Results

## What's Next
I want to expand the content on this resume website into more of blog. I think
it's duable but first I need to write the content. Also once the website starts
included blogging aspacts I'd need to do one more final redesign so that all the
blog content is easy to find and search for. 

To sum up my plans:

1. Write blog content
2. Small redesign to focus more on content instead of my resume

I think now that I am back at school for 2 more years, there's no better time then
now to start this. I find I am being taught a lot of content I already somewhat
know so I want to change that somewhat into a KNOW!

## Reflections
I think the biggest reveal was how bad I am at planning out my design. Recently
I have been exposed to Adobe XD and figma and am intrested in using these before
I jump into my next project.
