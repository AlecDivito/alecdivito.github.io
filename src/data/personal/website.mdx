## Overview
This website was created to act as a resume for my skills and hobbies for anyone
who is interested. Another reason why I created it was to give it the option of
expanding into something greater, such as a blog/notes website to show off what
I've learnt in school and in my free time.

## Goals
I wanted to make something that was easily extendable and looked good. It also
had to have a layout that was easy to read on mobile, tablet and desktop platforms.
The final goal was to make sure that it advertised my accomplishments and
projects that I have completed and am proud of as well as give a glimps of what
I'm currently working on.

## Technologies
I used Gatsby<sup>[[2](#refactoringui)]</sup> as my static site generator, I
really enjoyed using it and felt right at home because of how heavily it uses
React. I used Javascript instead of my usually frontend language of Typescript
and regert that, I really miss my types with my syntax highlighting and
have never had a good experince using proptypes. To style I used SCSS and focused
on using some parts of the BEM methodology.

The reason why I ended up using Javascript to code my website is because this was
my first time working with Gatsby and I had no clue that they had a plugin that
allowed a developer to compile they're website using Typescript. Whoops.

## Design/Development Process
This project has been on again and off again for at least 1 year at this point.
What really held me back the last time I took at stab at this was my designs and
planning because I had either. This time I decided to take the time to just draw
out some of my ideas as well as define a small sitemap that would cover all
the sections of the site.

<h3>Old Primary Colors</h3>
<div>
    <span class="color--square old-primary-1"></span>
</div>
<h3>Old Accent Colors</h3>
<div>
    <span class="color--square old-accent-1"></span>
</div>
<h3>Old Shades</h3>
<div>
    <span class="color--square old-shade-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square old-shade-2"></span>
</div>

After reading through refactoring UI<sup>[[1](#refactoringui)]</sup> blog post on
how important color are in an application as well as how important it is to have
diffrent shades I decided to actually spend some time actually coming up with a
good color palette with lots of colors to choose from. These are the colors and
shades I came up with:

<h3>Primary Color</h3>
<div>
    <span class="color--square primary-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-2"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-3"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-4"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-5"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-6"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-7"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-8"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-9"></span>
</div>

<h3>Accent Color</h3>
<div>
    <span class="color--square accent-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-2"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-3"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-4"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-5"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-6"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-7"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-8"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-9"></span>
</div>

<h3>Shades</h3>
<div>
    <span class="color--square shade-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-2"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-3"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-4"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-5"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-6"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-7"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-8"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-9"></span>
</div>

Already this looks better then the older shades, not only do we have more selection
to show new states of the application but we can also give diffrent colors to
diffrent alerts and such on the page.

## Difficulties
The biggiest difficulty was finding a good color and even now I'm still not
very satisfied with my pick of blues and 

After I starting pointing my filesystem in the correct directory most of my issues didn't matter as much anymore.


## Project Status
Is a resume ever done? No, so I guess this website is never done but that's ok.
But overall the website is currently at a completed stage that I am happy with.

## Results

## What's Next
I want to expand the content on this resume website into more of blog. I think
it's duable but first I need to write the content. Also once the website starts
included blogging aspacts I'd need to do one more final redesign so that all the
blog content is easy to find and search for. 

To sum up my plans:

1. Write blog content
2. Small redesign to focus more on content instead of my resume

I think now that I am back at school for 2 more years, there's no better time then
now to start this. I find I am being taught a lot of content I already somewhat
know so I want to change that somewhat into a KNOW!

## Reflections
I think the biggest reveal was how bad I am at planning out my design. Recently
I have been exposed to Adobe XD and figma and am intrested in using these before
I jump into my next project.
