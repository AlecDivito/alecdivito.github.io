## Overview


## Goals

## Technologies

## Design Process

## Difficulties
The biggiest hurrdle was reading in the diffrent file formats that bitmap offers.
most of the header of the file is always the same and really easy to read in but
what caught me off guard was 

## Project Status
This project is done. It works for most bitmaps found in the wild now-a-days
(which isn't common).

## Results

## What's Next
Adding some support for compiling the library down to webassembly. One of my
intrests is being able to share code accross code bases. I have attempted this
and am currently looking at a way of implmenting it.

## Reflections
This library is over designed and isn't usable right off the shelf, but it is
my first publiclly avaliable library. I think adding in the bitmap editing features
was a bit overkill but on the bright side I was able to implment image resizing
for linear, bilinear and bicubic interpolation. I liked how I got to play around
more with this project with actually file.

I decided to challenge myself and setup a continuous pipeline using travis.ci
which was also really cool. From now on I want to always have a way for my applications
to be continuously tested and deployed.

One thing I would want to improve is the lack of traits used in my code. I believe
my code could have been better if I added that in.

I threw away a lot of my code but I had an better understanding of my problem and
what I needed to accoplish after prototyping. I feel as though my code

To be honest this project was just a fun small little project to help me get
more comfortable with rust's low level and to actually deploy it to a package
registry which I did and for that I'm happy. This project accomplished it's final
goal, I hope my next project is easialy able to out shine this one.
