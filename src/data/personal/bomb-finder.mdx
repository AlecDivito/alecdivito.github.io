Minesweeper challenge

## Overview
I decided to re-make minesweeper from the ground up, as well as build upon by it
adding features like game templates, game statistics and settings. My main 
insperation for the project was to mimike a Google's Reasearch lab project they 
called proxx.app. The goal of the project was to remake minsweeper with updated 
graphics and as a PWA (progressive web app) thus allowing a wider audenince 
experince to have fun with a newly skined minesweeper game.

## Goals
Bomb finders initial goal was to just create the minesweeper game with animated
pieces. It begain to grow as I started to see the project as more of a learning
opprunity.
The goal was to create a PWA that scored 100 in all of the fields on the lighthouse
browser test. I also wanted to gain experince using Indexdb as a way of keeping
state on the client side as well as learning how to create fun experinces using
the browsers 2D engine, Canvas2d. 
The main way my app diffres from proxx is that I have more pages and I don't
have a fancy background animation (sadly). Proxx also used div tags and stored
theyre animations in there. I decided to only use a canvas element
// what was my aim when I took up this project
// talk about proxx goals and how mine deffer

## Failures
The project first began using preact and my own rolled webpack program but I had
trouble figuring out a way to let my do code-splitting as well as use typescript.
These furtrations lasted about a week and after unsuccessfully getting codespliting
to work I decided to switch to React's CRA (create-react-app) because of my
pervious experince and experince with it. CRA allowed me to quickly get the
project started and focus on the design of my components and pages. 


## Technologies
Bomb finder is build with React with Typescript. It currently isn't connected to
any backend services so it makes use of the browsers provided features to save
data. Currently I am using indexDB (if provided) to save all of the users data.
I chouse indexdb because it doesn't run on the main thread. If I were to use
session or local storage. 


## Deign process
I'm not a designer but I tried to follow a workflow this project.
I inital started out this project out by writing my goals for the projects
and all the pages I wanted.




## Project Status
This project is at a finished stage. It is mostly completed and is fully
usable and installable. There are still some small bugs that need to be
fixed but the initial 1.0 release works. A polish wouldn't hurt it. ed.




## What's Next
- Make bomb finder into a trusted web app
- Add more animations for game bored pieces
- Allow player's to pick they're color for the background on the game board
- Add a High score table
- Add way for friends to challenge eachother to a game
    - same seed
    - diffrent seed
    - competitive version
- Add way to turn off satified tiles
- Add way for users

## Reflections

Originally I wanted to build a simplier clone of Googles proxx.app but what
was supposed to be simple steam rolled into something a little bigger then
I first envisioned. The projected became bigger and bigger as I started adding
new features in the game like game templates, settings, and statistics.

This projects main goal was to experiment with PWA's and reacts implmentation
of them. As well as gain some experince working the some of the browser's
internal API's like canvas2d and indexDB. 

One of the main challenges I came across was using indexDB for saving games
and other items. There were issues were I couldn't update the store without
deleting it first as well as a poor implementation of a super class to handle
the reading and writing of data. I probably spent 5 days playing with the
implmentation of it. It's currently implmentation isn't bad but could be better.
I removed it as being a super class and changed it to a singlton. It works well
for creating the database from sratch and I haven't encountered anymore issues with it

At the end of the day this project is a completed project that I'm really proud
to show people. I learnt alot about chrome dev tools and profiling my perforamce
code. It was a lot of fun creating the animations and working with canvas2d. Using
react's "create react app" helped a lot to quickly get the project running. I 
can't wait till I have the time to fully polish the game off to how I want it to be.
