## Overview

Bomb Finder is meant to be a re-make of the popular game minesweeper. It was built
as a fun exercise that looked at adding small features to the game such as game
templates, game statistics and settings for graphics and game play. The main
inspiration for this project was brought on by Google creating they're own clone
called proxx<sup>[[1](#proxx)]</sup>.

## Goals

1. Make Bomb Finder a PWA (progressive web app) as well as score 100 in the lighthouse browser tests
2. Use Indexdb to persist data. Data represents settings, statistics, game templates and game's currently in progress
3. Bomb Finder should alway keep state, even when the game is turned off by the user
4. Bomb Finder should feel like a native app experience.
5. Canvas2d must be used for the game board

The goal was to remake minesweeper and create a PWA (progressive web app) that scored 100 in all of
the fields on the lighthouse browser test. I also wanted to gain experience using
Indexdb as a way of keeping state on the client side as well as learning how to
create fun experiences using the browsers 2D engine, Canvas2d. The power of havening
the web app as a PWA meant that user could download the app to they're home just
by visiting the page. There was no need for the user to download our app from the
app store.

## Technologies

Bomb Finder is build with React with Typescript. It currently isn't connected to
any backend services so it makes use of the browsers provided features to save
data. Currently I am using indexDB (if provided) to save all of the users data.
I choose Indexdb because it doesn't run on the main thread while session and
local storage do. This helps when rendering the game board at 60 fps and reduces
overhead of completing the operation in 0.0167 seconds.

## Design process

I'm not a designer but I try to follow a workflow for all of my projects. I initial
started out this project out by writing my goals for the projects and all the
pages I wanted. I then got started on deciding what pages I would want in my game
as well as simple designs of how I would expect it too look.

<div>
    <props.images.bomb_finder_inital_design alt="Initial paper draw design" />
    <props.images.bomb_finder_sitemap alt="Initial design of the sitemap" />
</div>

After mapping out what pages were needed I got started creating the project. Initially
the project used Preact and my own rolled webpack program but I had
trouble figuring out a way to let my do code-splitting as well as use typescript.
These frustrations lasted about a week and after unsuccessfully getting code splitting
to work I decided to switch to Reacts CRA<sup>[[4](#CRA)]</sup> (create-react-app) because of my
pervious experience and experience with it. CRA<sup>[[4](#CRA)]</sup> allowed me to quickly get the
project started and focus on the design of my components and pages.

I first started out by adding content to the pages first before I implemented designs.
This allowed me to move quickly in developing the app and getting all of the features
I wanted out of it like utilizing Indexdb and rendering with canvas2d. It also
allowed me to focus on developing the game mechanics.

After I had added all the feature's, I went back and filled that app out with a
very basic design, using a very sad color palette of shades:

<h4>Shades</h4>
<div>
    <span class="color--square bf-shade-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square bf-shade-2"></span>
    <span class="color--square bf-shade-3"></span>
</div>

## Difficulties and Challenges

Bomb Finder was pretty simple to create but because of some of the features that
I was trying to implement into the program I did run into some difficulties. One
of the biggest ones was when I was developing the game board. Initially I was moving
for piece to piece and drawing they're current state. This meant that I redrew each image
on every render loop. This wasn't a problem if the board was 5x5 but did become a
problem when playing on hard difficulties using a 24-by-24 grid. The first solution
to this problem was found on MDN<sup>[[3](#MDN)]</sup> where it said you can
render each piece alone on an invisible canvas, then copy and paste the invisible canvas
into the games canvas. This worked great and solved my problem on desktop but on
mobile I was still having issues with framerate. I realized that on mobile, you 
can't really see most of the screen anyways, so why not just skip rendering pieces
off screen. So I did that.

Aside from rendering problems, I also needed to come up with a way to read and write
data to Indexdb effectivity and in a way that hid all of the logic needed to
read and write from Indexdb. I decided to create class to model my data that I 
wanted saved and used annotations to register them as database classes on startup.
Once registered the browser will be able to create, select or edit the table so
it matches the data model.

One of the problems I wasn't able to solve was with the make shift ORM I made to
interact with Indexdb. To understand the problem you need to understand what CRA
does while compiling the program for development and what it does to compile the
program for production. While in development mode all of the classes
name's aren't simplified, this means when you call ```function.constructor.name```
you get the name of the class. In production all the class names are simplified
meaning that the name of the class at runtime has changed. Have the class name
change is a big deal during runtime because that means we need to manually set
the table that the field is supposed to belong to because there is not way to
get it during runtime without using a static string.

The result of this change made a nice looking data model like this:

```Typescript
@Table()
class Preferences {
    @Field(true)
    readonly id: string;

    @Field()
    defaultCellSize: number = 35;
    ...
}
```

Into this:

```Typescript
@Table("settings")
class Preferences {
    @Field("settings", true)
    readonly id: string;

    @Field("settings")
    defaultCellSize: number = 35;
    ...
}
```

This could be solved by ejecting the build config but that is a massive downside
compared to just hard coding the table name to all of the fields.

## Project Status

This project is at a finished stage. It is completed and is fully
usable and installable. I'm still deciding weather it's worth it to try and
extend the project.

## What's Next

- Make Bomb Finder into a trusted web app<sup>[[5](#TWA)]</sup>
- Allow player's to pick they're color for the background on the game board
- Add way to turn off satisfied tiles handicap
- Add more animations for game bored pieces
- Add a High score table (online functionality)
- Add way for friends to challenge each other to a game
  - same seed
  - different seed
  - competitive version
  - battle royal???

## Reflections

At the end of the day this project is a completed project that I'm really proud
to show people. I learned a lot about chrome dev tools and profiling my performance
code. It was a lot of fun creating the animations and working with canvas2d. Using
Reacts CRA helped a lot to quickly get the project running. I think this project
could have been improved by doing some initial design planning at the start of
project. It could have been a big asset to spend a couple of days in Figma<sup>[[6](#figma)]</sup>
to quickly prototype possible designs and color schemes that would be more attractive
then my sad color palette. Other then the design I feel as though I hit all my goals
I wanted to hit and am really proud of that!
