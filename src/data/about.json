        "description": "a Full Stack Developer and a 4th year Sheridan College student in Mobile Computing graduating december 2021 with an interest in cloud computing, full stack development and mobile development. My experience includes working at RBC on their cloud team where I helped develop their next generation pipeline for bank developers on Kubernetes to researching fall detection through The Centre for Mobile Innovation at Sheridan College. I’ve graduated once already from Sheridan College with an advanced diploma from Software Development and Network Engineering. In addition I have been to 4 hackathons where in one of them I have placed 3rd. Technology excites me a lot and I’m very excited playing with emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality and server less computing."
