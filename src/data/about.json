I have an interest in cloud computing, distributed actor model systems, programming languages that protect you from yourself (rust ðŸ¦€) and full stack development. My experience includes working at RBC on their platform teams where I've learned about Kubernetes, Terraform, and Azure. I've also worked for a startup called Ownr that helped to automate creating small business in canada! While in school, I had an interest in machine learning and did some research into fall detection through The Centre for Mobile Innovation at Sheridan College. Technology excites me a lot and I like to spend my free time on it, right now that trying to create my own serverless platform using web assembly."
