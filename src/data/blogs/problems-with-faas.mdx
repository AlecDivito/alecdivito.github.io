## Introduction

In pervious articles I covered what was going well with serverless but now I need
to review what needs to be solved before it can really be main stream.

Currently compaines normally use FAAS for batch type of jobs but we can optimize
functions for all use cases?

## Current Problems

THeres lots of current problems, they are:

- ephumeral storage
- stateful functions
- clear pricing
- quick execution
- data/execution sand boxing
