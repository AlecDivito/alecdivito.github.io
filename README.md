  Alec Di Vito's Resume Website (Built with gatsby)
</h1>

The website was made to be my own little corner of the internet. The goal is to keep it updated every 4 - 8 months. I also want to use it as a place to store some of my class notes and self taught material in the form of blog posts. Sometimes I learn cool stuff (like math) and forget it.

## Project Status
Are personal websites ever finished??? First draft with most of the important information is completed.

## Project Goals
Keep an up-to-date project that shows off some of my web design skills and other projects that may not get much attention if not posted somewhere.
